        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, celery, and carrot; cook until softened. Add garlic and cook 1 minute. Add veal, pork, and beef. Cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is no longer pink.</li>
            <li>Add wine and reduce for 1 minute. Stir in broth. Add rosemary, Italian seasoning, bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Uncover and reduce until almost dry. Discard bay leaf and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over moderately low heat. Whisk in flour for about 2 minutes. Whisk in milk, grated nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and parsley. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Transfer cooled meat mixture to a large bowl and mix in egg yolks. Stir in cheese and parsley sauce; set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine tomato sauce and cream in a bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Generously coat a gratin dish with butter.</li>
            <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Cut pasta sheets crosswise into 5-inch lengths, then cook noodles, a few at a time, until al dente, 1 to 2 minutes for fresh pasta. Transfer pasta to a bowl of cold water. Spread noodles in a single layer on paper towels to drain.</li>
            <li>Spoon 1/4 cup filling down the center of one noodle; roll noodle to enclose filling. Transfer cannelloni, seam-side down, to the prepared gratin dish. Repeat with remaining noodles and filling, arranging in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Ladle tomato cream sauce over filled cannelloni and sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 10 minutes. Turn the broiler on and continue cooking until top is golden, about 2 minutes.</li>
